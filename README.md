<hr/>

about me
- :parachute: I work at a Trade Marketing tech company as a Data Quality Analyst. 
- :rainbow: Passionate about building things from scratch, joining meaningful projects, and fostering a sense of community. 
- ✨ Growing from Data Quality into Data & Business Analytics — learning Python, Power BI, and data storytelling.
- 📚 This whole data adventure started in an internship — two years of learning SQL, Databricks, and how clean data builds better AI.
- 🏃 I love running! After a whole day at the computer, I just need to step outside and let the wind clear my thoughts.
- 🍃 Kinda addicted to chocolate and movies.
