🌐 About Me

- ✨ Expanding my path from Data Quality into Data & Business Analytics — learning Python, Power BI, and data storytelling.
- 📚 This whole data adventure started in an internship — two years of learning SQL, Databricks, and how clean data builds better AI.
- :parachute: I work at a Trade Marketing tech company as a Data Quality Analyst. 
- 🍃 Kinda addicted to chocolate and movies.
- 🏃 I love running.
